# Variational construction of tubular and toroidal streamsurfaces for flow visualization

This repo includes the code and data for our paper on the extraction of approximate streamsurfaces for flow visualization. Our approach is based on a variational construction. We use finite element methods to solve for an eigenvalue problem whose eigenvectors are the streamsurfaces we seek for. 

We use FEniCS for the implementation of the finite element methods. The code we provide is in the format of Jupyter Notebook files, which can be run in FEniCS. More info about running a Jupyter notebook with a FEniCS environment installed can be found at the link below
https://fenics.readthedocs.io/projects/containers/en/latest/jupyter.html

In each example, we provide Jupyter Notebook files as well as some MATLAB files for post processing. You are expected to run the Jupyter Notebook files firstly becuase such run will generate some data files, which will be loaded when you run MATLAB files for post-processing.
